      <description>Last June, I participated in the second edition of the “Pot-au-jeu” game jam organized by the french Youtuber At0mium. Last year, I made a game named Paperboy Droid which was ranked second in the gameplay category. This year, I made a game named “Le mystère des pierres” (The mystery of stones). It’s a puzzle game where the player moves stones to give orders to a robot. Without knowing it, the player will learn the basic notions of programming.</description>

      <description>It has been almost a year since the last article I wrote on this blog. This year has been one of the busiest I ever had. After last year&amp;rsquo;s game jam, I decided to try going serious about making games. I asked for a part-time job and planned to make a game that could be sold within a year. This was intended to be a test to see if it would be a viable option to start making games full time.</description>

      <title>A Game Jam That Mattered</title>

      <description>A bit more than two weeks ago, I took part in a game jam organized by a french Youtuber (At0mium). For those who don’t know what a game jam is, it’s basically a video game creation contest where you create a game within a short period of time. In my case, I created the game from scratch during a weekend on the theme: “Faire du neuf avec du vieux”. When I enrolled, I thought that it would be a fun experience and a small break from my current project.</description>

      <description>I created Paperboy Droid in a weekend for At0mium&amp;rsquo;s POT-AU-JEU Game Jam on the theme: Make something new with something old! Paperboy Droid is a remake of Paperboy by Tiger Electronics. This is the first game my dad gave me when I was little. I completely changed the mechanics of the game: you have to program a droid that will play for you by performing the actions of your program. I created the game alone during the game jam weekend, without using prefabricated elements.</description>

      <description>A few days after finishing Great Bee (the first game I actually released), I went to a barbecue at my wife’s family. Of course, I took my computer with the game on it. At that point, I had no idea what kind of feedback I would get. I just let them play the game.
The test started with my wife’s little sister who is in primary school. It was before dinner.</description>

      <title>Great Bee</title>

      <description>In Great Bee, you play a bee that have to forage all the flowers in every level. The frog and the sun are your enemies. Colliding with them kills you. The sun is moving slowly, but the frog is accelerating over time. The sun can also be helpful because when it touches a flower, it will turn it into a strawberry. When you eat a strawberry, you become a super bee for a few seconds and you can slap the frog to reset its speed.</description>

      <description>I just finished my first game! It&amp;rsquo;s called Great Bee. You can play it online on itch.io or download it for free. Please share it with your friends if you like it and feel free to write any feedback on the game. In Great Bee, you play a bee that have to forage all the flowers in every level.

      <title>PICO-8 - A Childhood Dream</title>
      <link>https://dr-picnic.com/blog/pico-8/</link>

      <description>I read a lot of positive reviews about the PICO-8 fantasy console. Instead of listing the good points it has, I will tell you my story with PICO-8. For those who don’t know, it is a fake console that allows making games within the console itself. This includes code, graphics, sound, music, and maps. The games can be easily shared as PNG cartridge images.
First, a little background. Short version. I started creating video games long ago and I really loved it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been passionate about programming and what can be achieved with it since my childhood. I explored a lot of areas in software development such as 2D and 3D games, web applications, real-time and embedded software, functional programming, formal methods, machine learning, data visualization, and deployment. I started a lot of projects and I’m always working on some of them. This is what makes me feel alive: unleashing my creativity to solve new problems while making things work.</description>
