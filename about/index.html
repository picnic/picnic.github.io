        <p>I&rsquo;ve been passionate about programming and what can be achieved with it since my childhood. I explored a lot of areas in software development such as 2D and 3D games, web applications, real-time and embedded software, functional programming, formal methods, machine learning, data visualization, and deployment. I started a lot of projects and Iâ€™m always working on some of them. This is what makes me feel alive: unleashing my creativity to solve new problems while making things work. Almost all the projects I worked on are linked to one of my two main passions (and sometimes both): programming and games. This large background gives me the ability to solve complex problems using a broad range of knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>For a long time, my main issue has been that I wasnâ€™t able to complete my projects. Two reasons led to this situation. The first one is that it is almost impossible for me to work on something when Iâ€™m not passionate about it and my passions donâ€™t last long enough. I always get interested in something new and I begin a new project. The second reason is that I was always starting huge projects. I was so passionate at the beginning of each project that it has to be a lifetime project. With time, and driven by professional obligations, I learned to solve this issue while still living my passion. Now, I always start new projects with a small first step and make it grow step by step. I also make sure that I have some ways to keep my motivation long enough to reach my next goal on the project. Since this change, Iâ€™ve been really happy to be able to share the results of my projects, even if they are often very simple.</p>

<p>Currently, my main interests are programming, educational games, other games, the Arabic language, and drawing. When Iâ€™m not working on my projects I spend quality time with my charming wife and my lovely daughter.</p>
