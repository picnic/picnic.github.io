        <p>In the context of Covid-19, I stayed with my parents for a few weeks, sick.
I was still able to do activities for a few hours a day.
So I finally decided to learn how to draw.
My drawing skills have been a limitation for many of my projects, whether they are video games, board games or educational tools.</p>

<p>On April 6, I started a challenge to get started. I opened an account
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_picnic/">instagram</a> on which I posted one drawing a day for 21 days.
I took a beginner&rsquo;s course on Udemy that helped me get started. I always wanted to know how to draw, but I never dared to start. I had the impression
that it was not for me, that it was inaccessible to me. I was wrong.</p>

<p>I finally took a lot of pleasure to accomplish
this challenge. I loved taking the classes and doing my first drawings. Of course, it was a matter of copying models
step by step, and I am still far from being able to be creative and create my own
characters. However, I have gained confidence in myself. I feel now that I could reach a decent level in drawing if I work at it.</p>

<p>Apart from drawing, I really miss making games. It&rsquo;s been several months now
I haven&rsquo;t made any games at all. I can&rsquo;t help but imagine game mechanics and stories whenever I have some free time.
Even though I really enjoy my current job, I would like to spend more time on my game projects again. So I imagined myself
creating games and making a living doing it. But, if I have learned anything during
2019, it is that it is extremely difficult to complete a full video game project. Also,
finishing a game, even a very good one, is not enough to make a living from it. Moreover, I rely a lot on my progress in drawing
to be able to produce games in the future. So my goal for the next year is
to concentrate on drawing. I will also start to make video games again, but I won&rsquo;t start a complete game project.
I&rsquo;m just going to practice what I&rsquo;m learning to draw. It will also be a good opportunity to read books on game design and
Character Design.</p>

<p>Once I have acquired new skills, I will definitely start working on a more serious video game project.
I&rsquo;m starting to think about a strategy to choose among my many game ideas the one that will be the most adapted to stay
motivated and finish a big project.</p>
