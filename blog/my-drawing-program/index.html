      <p class="card-text"><p>On April 6, I started a challenge to learn how to draw. I opened an
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_picnic/">instagram</a> account on which I published a drawing a day for 21 days.
I took a beginner&rsquo;s course on Udemy which helped me get started. I always wanted to know how to draw.
My bad drawing abilities have always been a
big limitation for my personal projects. However, I never dared to learn it. I felt like it was not possible for me. I was wrong. I really enjoyed doing
this challenge.</p>

<p>I loved taking the lessons and doing my first drawings. It was about copying models,
step by step. Admittedly, I&rsquo;m still far from being able to be creative and create my own
characters for example. But I gained confidence in myself. I feel now that I can reach a
good level if I practice a lot. The pleasure I take in drawing should facilitate
this goal. In order to progress quickly, I planned a program based on the book of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmndBJ0V1pGx1GYyIOYafNA">Yoann Bomal</a>.
His book explains how he
did to progress in a year to integrate the Goblins school. My program consists of drawing an hour
every day in a sketchbook by regularly practicing the following techniques: warm-up,
anatomy, observation drawing, gesture, composition, colors. At first, I will stick to this
program up to 528 hours of drawing. It should take me about a year.</p>

<p>Apart from the drawing program, I really miss creating games. It&rsquo;s been several months now
that I no longer created any games at all. I can’t help but imagine game mechanics and
stories as soon as I have a free moment. Even though I like my current job a lot, I started to think that
I would love to spend more time on my game projects. So I imagined myself again
creating games and living off this activity. But I learned something during
2019: it is extremely difficult to complete a full video game project. Furthermore,
finishing a game, even a very good one, is not enough to make a living from it. In addition, I count a lot on my drawing progress
to be able to produce quality games in the future. The goal that I set for the upcoming year is, therefore,
to focus on drawing and in particular to finish my program. I may also work on some video game projects, but not a complete game project. I&rsquo;m just going to practice
what I&rsquo;m learning to draw. It will also be a good opportunity to read books on Game Design and
Character Design.</p>

<p>Once the drawing program is finished, I will certainly start a more serious video game project.
I’m already starting to think about a strategy to choose among my many game ideas the one that
will be the best way to stay motivated and finish a big project.</p>
